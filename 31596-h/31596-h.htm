<p style="text-align: left;">NOTE BY WILLIAM MORRIS
ON HIS AIMS IN FOUNDING
THE KELMSCOTT PRESS</p>

<p>I began printing books with
the hope of producing some which
would have a definite claim to
beauty, while at the same time
they should be easy to read and
should not dazzle the eye, or trouble
the intellect of the reader by eccentricity
of form in the letters. I have always
been a great admirer of the calligraphy of
the Middle Ages, &amp; of the earlier printing
which took its place. As to the fifteenth-century
books, I had noticed that they
were always beautiful by force of the mere
typography, even without the added ornament,
with which many of them are
so lavishly supplied. And it was the essence
of my undertaking to produce books
which it would be a pleasure to look upon
as pieces of printing and arrangement of
type. Looking at my adventure from this
point of view then, I found I had to consider
chiefly the following things: the
paper, the form of the type, the relative
spacing of the letters, the words, and the
lines; and lastly the position of the printed matter on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
page. It was a matter of course that I should consider it
necessary that the paper should be hand-made, both for
the sake of durability and appearance. It would be a very
false economy to stint in the quality of the paper as to price:
so I had only to think about the kind of hand-made paper.
On this head I came to two conclusions: 1st, that the paper
must be wholly of linen (most hand-made papers are of
cotton today), and must be quite &lsquo;hard,&rsquo; i. e., thoroughly
well sized; and 2nd, that, though it must be &lsquo;laid&rsquo; and not
&lsquo;wove&rsquo; (i. e., made on a mould made of obvious wires),
the lines caused by the wires of the mould must not be too
strong, so as to give a ribbed appearance. I found that on
these points I was at one with the practice of the paper-makers
of the fifteenth century; so I took as my model a
Bolognese paper of about 1473. My friend Mr. Batchelor,
of Little Chart, Kent, carried out my views very satisfactorily,
and produced from the first the excellent paper, which
I still use.</p>

<p>Next as to type. By instinct rather than by conscious
thinking it over, I began by getting myself a fount of Roman
type. And here what I wanted was letter pure in
form; severe, without needless excrescences; solid, without
the thickening and thinning of the line, which is the essential
fault of the ordinary modern type, and which makes
it difficult to read; and not compressed laterally, as all later
type has grown to be owing to commercial exigencies.
There was only one source from which to take examples
of this perfected Roman type, to wit, the works of the
great Venetian printers of the fifteenth century, of whom
Nicholas Jenson produced the completest and most Roman
characters from 1470 to 1476. This type I studied
with much care, getting it photographed to a big scale, and
drawing it over many times before I began designing my
own letter; so that though I think I mastered the essence
of it, I did not copy it servilely; in fact, my Roman type,
especially in the lower case, tends rather more to the Gothic
than does Jenson&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>After a while I felt that I must have a Gothic as well as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Roman fount; and herein the task I set myself was to redeem
the Gothic character from the charge of unreadableness
which is commonly brought against it. And I felt that
this charge could not be reasonably brought against the
types of the first two decades of printing: that Schoeffer
at Mainz, Mentelin at Strasburg, and Gunther Zainer at
Augsburg, avoided the spiky ends and undue compression
which lay some of the later type open to the above
charge. Only the earlier printers (naturally following
therein the practice of their predecessors the scribes) were
very liberal of contractions, and used an excess of &lsquo;tied&rsquo;
letters, which, by the way, are very useful to the compositor.
So I entirely eschewed contractions, except for the
&lsquo;&amp;,&rsquo; and had very few tied letters, in fact none but the
absolutely necessary ones. Keeping my end steadily in
view, I designed a black-letter type which I think I may
claim to be as readable as a Roman one, and to say the
truth I prefer it to the Roman. This type is of the size
called Great Primer (the Roman type is of &lsquo;English&rsquo; size);
but later on I was driven by the necessities of the Chaucer
(a double-columned book) to get a smaller Gothic type of
Pica size.</p>

<p>The punches for all these types, I may mention, were cut
for me with great intelligence and skill by Mr. E. P. Prince,
and render my designs most satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Now as to the spacing: First, the &lsquo;face&rsquo; of the letter should
be as nearly conterminous with the &lsquo;body&rsquo; as possible, so
as to avoid undue whites between the letters. Next, the
lateral spaces between the words should be (a) no more
than is necessary to distinguish clearly the division into
words, and (b) should be as nearly equal as possible. Modern
printers, even the best, pay very little heed to these
two essentials of seemly composition, and the inferior ones
run riot in licentious spacing, thereby producing, inter
alia, those ugly rivers of lines running about the page which
are such a blemish to decent printing. Third, the whites
between the lines should not be excessive; the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
practice of &lsquo;leading&rsquo; should be used as little as possible,
and never without some definite reason, such as marking
some special piece of printing. The only leading I have
allowed myself is in some cases a &lsquo;thin&rsquo; lead between the
lines of my Gothic pica type: in the Chaucer and the double-columned
books I have used a &lsquo;hair&rsquo; lead, and not even
this in the 16mo books. Lastly, but by no means least,
comes the position of the printed matter on the page. This
should always leave the inner margin the narrowest, the
top somewhat wider, the outside (fore-edge) wider still,
and the bottom widest of all. This rule is never departed
from in medi&aelig;val books, written or printed. Modern printers
systematically <a name="transgress" id="transgress"></a><span class="ins" title="Originally: trangress">transgress</span> against it; thus apparently contradicting
the fact that the unit of a book is not one page,
but a pair of pages. A friend, the librarian of one of our
most important private libraries, tells me that after careful
testing he has come to the conclusion that the medi&aelig;val
rule was to make a difference of 20 per cent. from margin
to margin. Now these matters of spacing and position are
of the greatest importance in the production of beautiful
books; if they are properly considered they will make a
book printed in quite ordinary type at least decent and
pleasant to the eye. The disregard of them will spoil the
effect of the best designed type.</p>

<p>It was only natural that I, a decorator by profession, should
attempt to ornament my books suitably: about this matter,
I will only say that I have always tried to keep in mind
the necessity for making my decoration a part of the page
of type. I may add that in designing the magnificent and
inimitable woodcuts which have adorned several of my
books, and will above all adorn the Chaucer which is now
drawing near completion, my friend Sir Edward Burne-Jones
has never lost sight of this important point, so that
his work will not only give us a series of most beautiful
and imaginative pictures, but form the most harmonious
decoration possible to the printed book.</p>

Kelmscott House, Upper Mall, Hammersmith. Nov. 11, 1895<br /></p>

<h2 style="font-size: 110%; text-align: left;">A SHORT HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE
KELMSCOTT PRESS.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></h2>

<p>The foregoing <a name="article" id="article"></a><span class="ins" title="Originally: artitcle">article</span> was written at the request of a London
bookseller for an American client who was about to
read a paper on the Kelmscott Press. As the Press is now
closing, and its seven years&rsquo; existence will soon be a matter
of history, it seems fitting to set down some other facts
concerning it while they can still be verified; the more so
as statements founded on imperfect information have appeared
from time to time in newspapers and reviews.</p>

<p>As early as 1866 an edition of The Earthly Paradise was
projected, which was to have been a folio in double columns,
profusely illustrated by Sir Edward Burne-Jones,
and typographically superior to the books of that time.
The designs for the stories of Cupid and Psyche, Pygmalion
and the Image, The Ring given to Venus, and the Hill
of Venus, were finished, and forty-four of those for Cupid
and <a name="Psyche" id="Psyche"></a><span class="ins" title="Originally: Pysche">Psyche</span> were engraved on wood in line, somewhat in
the manner of the early German masters. About thirty-five
of the blocks were executed by William Morris himself,
and the remainder by George Y. Wardle, G. F. Campfield,
C. J. Faulkner, and Miss Elizabeth Burden. Specimen
pages were set up in Caslon type, and in the Chiswick
Press type afterwards used in The House of the
Wolfings, but for various reasons the project went no further.
Four or five years later there was a plan for an illustrated
edition of Love is Enough, for which two initial L&rsquo;s
and seven side ornaments were drawn and engraved by
William Morris. Another marginal ornament was engraved
by him from a design by Sir E. Burne-Jones, who also
drew a picture for the frontispiece, which has now been
engraved by W. H. Hooper for the final page of the Kelmscott
Press edition of the work. These side ornaments,
three of which appear on the opposite page, are more delicate
than any that were designed for the Kelmscott Press,
but they show that when the Press was started the idea
of reviving some of the decorative features of the earliest
printed books had been long in its founder&rsquo;s mind. At this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
same period, in the early seventies, he was much absorbed in
the study of ancient manuscripts, and in writing out and illuminating
various books, including a Horace and an Omar
Khayyám, which may have led his thoughts away from printing.
In any case, the plan of an illustrated Love is Enough,
like that of the folio Earthly Paradise, was abandoned.</p>

<p>Although the books written by William Morris continued
to be reasonably printed, it was not until about 1888 that
he again paid much attention to typography. He was then,
and for the rest of his life, when not away from Hammersmith,
in daily communication with his friend and neighbour
Emery Walker, whose views on the subject coincided
with his own, and who had besides a practical knowledge
of the technique of printing. These views were first expressed
in an article by Mr. Walker in the catalogue of the
exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, held
at the New Gallery in the autumn of 1888. As a result of
many conversations, The House of the Wolfings was printed
at the Chiswick Press at this time, with a special type modelled
on an old Basel fount, unleaded, and with due regard
to proportion in the margins. The title-page was also carefully
arranged. In the following year The Roots of the
Mountains was printed with the same type (except the
lower case e), but with a differently proportioned page,
and with shoulder-notes instead of head-lines. This book
was published in November, 1889, and its author declared
it to be the best-looking book issued since the seventeenth
century. Instead of large paper copies, which had been
found unsatisfactory in the case of The House of the Wolfings,
two hundred and fifty copies were printed on Whatman
paper of about the same size as the paper of the ordinary
copies. A small stock of this paper remained over,
and in order to dispose of it seventy-five copies of the
translation of the Gunnlaug Saga, which first appeared in
the Fortnightly Review of January, 1869, and afterwards
in Three Northern Love Stories, were printed at the Chiswick
Press. The type used was a black-letter copied from
one of Caxton&rsquo;s founts, and the initials were left blank to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"><!-- [7] --></a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[7&ndash;8]</a></span>
be <a name="rubricated" id="rubricated"></a><span class="ins" title="Originally: rubicated">rubricated</span> by hand. Three copies were printed on vellum.
This little book was not however finished until November,
1890.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile William Morris had resolved to design a type
of his own. Immediately after The Roots of the Mountains
appeared, he set to work upon it, and in December,
1889, he asked Mr. Walker to go into partnership with
him as a printer. This offer was declined by Mr. Walker;
but, though not concerned with the financial side of the
enterprise, he was virtually a partner in the Kelmscott
Press from its first beginnings to its end, and no important
step was taken without his advice and approval. Indeed,
the original intention was to have the books set up in
Hammersmith and printed at his office in Clifford&rsquo;s Inn.
It was at this time that William Morris began to collect
the medi&aelig;val books of which he formed so fine a library
in the next six years. He had made a small collection of
such books years before, but had parted with most of
them, to his great regret. He now bought with the definite
purpose of studying the type and methods of the early
printers. Among the first books so acquired was a copy
of Leonard of Arezzo&rsquo;s History of Florence, printed at
Venice by Jacobus Rubeus in 1476, in a Roman type very
similar to that of Nicholas Jenson. Parts of this book and
of Jenson&rsquo;s Pliny of 1476 were enlarged by photography
in order to bring out more clearly the characteristics of
the various letters; and having mastered both their virtues
and defects, William Morris proceeded to design the fount
of type which, in the list of December, 1892, he named the
Golden type, from The Golden Legend, which was to have
been the first book printed with it. This fount consists of
eighty-one designs, including stops, figures, and tied letters.
The lower case alphabet was finished in a few months.
The first letter having been cut in Great Primer size by
Mr. Prince, was thought too large, and &lsquo;English&rsquo; was the
size resolved upon. By the middle of August, 1890, eleven
punches had been cut. At the end of the year the fount
was all but complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>On Jan. 12th, 1891, a cottage, No. 16, Upper Mall, was taken.
Mr. William Bowden, a retired master-printer, had already
been engaged to act as compositor and pressman. Enough
type was then cast for a trial page, which was set up and
printed on Saturday, Jan. 31st, on a sample of the paper
that was being made for the Press by J. Batchelor and Son.
About a fortnight later ten reams of paper were delivered.
On Feb. 18th a good supply of type followed. Mr. W. H.
Bowden, who subsequently became overseer, then joined
his father as compositor, and the first chapters of The Glittering
Plain were set up. The first sheet appears to have
been printed on March 2nd, when the staff was increased
to three by the addition of a pressman named Giles, who
left as soon as the book was finished. A friend who saw
William Morris on the day after the printing of the page
above mentioned recalls his elation at the success of his
new type. The first volume of the Saga Library, a creditable
piece of printing, was brought out and put beside this
trial page, which much more than held its own. The poet
then declared his intention to set to work immediately on
a black-letter fount; illness, however, intervened and it
was not begun until June. The lower case alphabet was
finished by the beginning of August, with the exception of
the tied letters, the designs for which, with those for the
capitals, were sent to Mr. Prince on September 11th. Early
in November enough type was cast for two trial pages,
the one consisting of twenty-six lines of Chaucer&rsquo;s Franklin&rsquo;s
Tale and the other of sixteen lines of Sigurd the Volsung.
In each of these a capital I is used that was immediately
discarded. On the last day of 1891 the full stock
of Troy type was despatched from the foundry. Its first
appearance was in a paragraph, announcing the book from
which it took its name, in the list dated May, 1892.</p>

<p>This Troy type, which its designer preferred to either of
the others, shows the influence of the beautiful early types
of Peter Schoeffer of Mainz, Gunther Zainer of Augsburg,
and Anthony Koburger of Nuremberg; but, even more than
the Golden type, it has a strong character of its own, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
differs largely from that of any medi&aelig;val fount. It has
recently been pirated abroad, and is advertised by an enterprising
German firm as &lsquo;Die amerikanische Triumph-Gothisch.&rsquo;
The Golden type has perhaps fared worse in
being remodelled in the United States, whence, with much
of its character lost, it has found its way back to England
under the names &lsquo;Venetian,&rsquo; &lsquo;Italian,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Jenson.&rsquo; It is
strange that no one has yet had the good sense to have
the actual type of Nicholas Jenson reproduced.</p>

<p>The third type used at the Kelmscott Press, called the
&lsquo;Chaucer,&rsquo; differs from the Troy type only in size, being
Pica instead of Great Primer. It was cut by Mr. Prince
between February and May, 1892, and was ready in June.
Its first appearance is in the list of chapters and glossary
of The Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye, which was
issued on November 24th, 1892.</p>

<p>On June 2nd of that year, William Morris wrote to Mr.
Prince: &lsquo;I believe in about three months&rsquo; time I shall be
ready with a new set of sketches for a fount of type on
English body.&rsquo; These sketches were not forthcoming; but
on Nov. 5th, 1892, he bought a copy of
Augustinus De
Civitate Dei, printed at the Monastery of Subiaco near
Rome by Sweynheym and Pannartz, with a rather compressed
type, which appears in only three known books.
He at once designed a lower case alphabet on this model,
but was not satisfied with it and did not have it cut. This
was his last actual experiment in the designing of type,
though he sometimes talked of designing a new fount, and
of having the Golden type cut in a larger size.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the type are the initials, borders,
and ornaments designed by William Morris. The first book
contains a single recto border and twenty different initials.
In the next book, Poems by the Way, the number of different
initials is fifty-nine. These early initials, many of
which were soon discarded, are for the most part suggestive,
like the first border, of the ornament in Italian manuscripts
of the fifteenth century. In Blunt&rsquo;s Love Lyrics there
are seven letters of a new alphabet, with backgrounds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
naturalesque grapes and vine leaves, the result of a visit
to Beauvais, where the great porches are carved with vines,
in August, 1891. From that time onwards fresh designs were
constantly added, the tendency being always towards larger
foliage and lighter backgrounds, as the early initials were
found to be sometimes too dark for the type. The total
number of initials of various sizes designed for the Kelmscott
Press, including a few that were engraved but never
used, is three hundred and eighty-four. Of the letter T
alone there are no less than thirty-four varieties.</p>

<p>The total number of different borders engraved for the
Press, including one that was not used, but excluding the
three borders designed for The Earthly Paradise by R.
Catterson-Smith, is fifty-seven. The first book to contain
a marginal ornament, other than these full borders, was
The Defence of Guenevere, which has a half-border on
p. 74. There are two others in the preface to The Golden
Legend. The Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye is the
first book in which there is a profusion of such ornament.
One hundred and eight different designs for marginal ornaments
were engraved. Besides the above-named designs,
there are seven frames for the pictures in The Glittering
Plain, one frame for those in a projected edition of
The House of the Wolfings, nineteen frames for the pictures
in the Chaucer (one of which was not used in the
book), twenty-eight title-pages and inscriptions, twenty-six
large initial words for the Chaucer, seven initial words
for The Well at the World&rsquo;s End and The Water of the
Wondrous Isles, four line-endings, and three printer&rsquo;s
marks, making a total of six hundred and forty-four designs
by William Morris, drawn and engraved within seven
years. All the initials and ornaments that recur were printed
from electrotypes, while most of the title-pages and initial
words were printed direct from the wood. The illustrations
by Sir Edward Burne-Jones, Walter Crane, and C. M.
Gere were also, with one or two exceptions, printed from
the wood. The original designs by Sir E. Burne-Jones
were nearly all in pencil, and were redrawn in ink by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
R. Catterson-Smith, and in a few cases by C. Fairfax Murray;
they were then revised by the artist and transferred to the
wood by means of photography. The twelve designs by
A. J. Gaskin for Spenser&rsquo;s Shepheardes <a name="Calender" id="Calender"></a><span class="ins" title="Originally: Calendar">Calender</span>, the map
in The Sundering Flood, and the thirty-five reproductions
in Some German Woodcuts of the Fifteenth Century, were
printed from process blocks.</p>

<p>All the wood blocks for initials, ornaments, and illustrations,
were engraved by W. H. Hooper, C. E. Keates, and
W. Spielmeyer, except the twenty-three blocks for The
Glittering Plain, which were engraved by A. Leverett, and
a few of the earliest initials, engraved by G. F. Campfield.
The whole of these wood blocks have been sent to the
British Museum, and have been accepted with a condition
that they shall not be reproduced or printed from for the
space of a hundred years. The electrotypes have been
destroyed. In taking this course, which was sanctioned
by William Morris when the matter was talked of shortly
before his death, the aim of the trustees has been to keep
the series of Kelmscott Press books as a thing apart, and
to prevent the designs becoming stale by constant repetition.
Many of them have been stolen and parodied in
America, but in this country they are fortunately copyright.
The type remains in the hands of the trustees, and will
be used for the printing of its designer&rsquo;s works, should special
editions be called for. Other books of which he would
have approved may also be printed with it; the absence of
initials and ornament will always distinguish them sufficiently
from the books printed at the Kelmscott Press.</p>

<p>The nature of the English <a name="hand_made" id="hand_made"></a><span class="ins" title="Originally: handmade">hand-made</span> paper used at the
Press has been described by William Morris in the foregoing
article. It was at first supplied in sheets of which
the dimensions were sixteen inches by eleven. Each sheet
had as a watermark a conventional primrose between the
initials W. M. As stated above, The Golden Legend was
to have been the first book put in hand, but as only two
pages could have been printed at a time, and this would
have made it very costly, paper of double the size was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
ordered for this work, and The Story of the Glittering
Plain was begun instead. This book is a small quarto, as
are its five immediate successors, each sheet being folded
twice. The last ream of the smaller size of paper was used
on The Order of Chivalry. All the other volumes of that
series are printed in octavo, on paper of the double size.
For the Chaucer a stouter and slightly larger paper was
needed. This has for its watermark a Perch with a spray
in its mouth. Many of the large quarto books were printed
on this paper, of which the first two reams were delivered
in February, 1893. Only one other size of paper was used
at the Kelmscott Press. The watermark of this is an Apple,
with the initials W. M., as in the other two watermarks.
The books printed on this paper are The Earthly Paradise,
The Floure and the Leafe, The Shepheardes Calender, and
Sigurd the Volsung. The last-named is a folio, and the
open book shows the size of the sheet, which is about eighteen
inches by thirteen. The first supply of this Apple paper
was delivered on March 15, 1895.</p>

<p>Except in the case of Blunt&rsquo;s Love Lyrics, The Nature of
Gothic, Biblia Innocentium, The Golden Legend, and The
Book of Wisdom and Lies, a few copies of all the books
were printed on vellum. The six copies of The Glittering
Plain were printed on very fine vellum obtained from Rome,
of which it was impossible to get a second supply as it was
all required by the Vatican. The vellum for the other books,
except for two or three copies of Poems by the Way, which
were on the Roman vellum, was supplied by H. Band of
Brentford, and by W. J. Turney &amp; Co. of Stourbridge.
There are three complete vellum sets in existence, and the
extreme difficulty of completing a set after the copies are
scattered, makes it unlikely that there will ever be a fourth.</p>

<p>The black ink which proved most satisfactory, after that of
more than one English firm had been tried, was obtained
from Hanover. William Morris often spoke of making his
own ink, in order to be certain of the ingredients, but his
intention was never carried out.</p>

<p>The binding of the books in vellum and in half-holland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was from the first done by J. &amp; J. Leighton. Most of the
vellum used was white, or nearly so, but William Morris
himself preferred it dark, and the skins showing brown
hair-marks were reserved for the binding of his own copies
of the books. The silk ties of four colours, red, blue, yellow,
and green, were specially woven and dyed.</p>

<p>In the following section fifty-two works, in sixty-six volumes,
are described as having been printed at the Kelmscott
Press, besides the two pages of Froissart&rsquo;s Chronicles.
It is scarcely necessary to add that only hand presses have
been used, of the type known as &lsquo;Albion.&rsquo; In the early days
there was only one press on which the books were printed,
besides a small press for taking proofs. At the end of May,
1891, larger premises were taken at 14, Upper Mall, next
door to the cottage already referred to, which was given
up in June. In November, 1891, a second press was bought,
as The Golden Legend was not yet half finished, and it
seemed as though the last of its 1286 pages would never
be reached. Three years later another small house was
taken, No. 14 being still retained. This was No. 21, Upper
Mall, overlooking the river, which acted as a reflector, so
that there was an excellent light for printing. In January,
1895, a third press, specially made for the work, was set
up here in order that two presses might be employed on
the Chaucer. This press has already passed into other
hands, and the little house, with its many associations, and
its pleasant outlook towards Chiswick and Mortlake, is
now being transformed into a granary. The last sheet
printed there was that on which are the frontispiece and
title of this book.</p>

<p>This book was set up from Nos. 81-4 of the English Illustrated
Magazine, in which it first appeared; some of the
chapter headings were re-arranged, and a few small corrections
were made in the text. A trial page, the first printed
at the Press, was struck off on January 31, 1891, but the first
sheet was not printed until about a month later. The border
was designed in January of the same year, and engraved by
W. H. Hooper. Mr. Morris had four of the vellum copies
bound in green vellum, three of which he gave to friends.
Only two copies on vellum were sold, at twelve and fifteen
guineas. This was the only book with washleather ties. All
the other vellum-bound books have silk ties, except Shelley&rsquo;s
Poems and Hand and Soul, which have no ties.</p>

<p>This was the first book printed at the Kelmscott Press in two
colours, and the first book in which the smaller printer&rsquo;s
mark appeared. After The Glittering Plain was finished,
at the beginning of April, no printing was done until May
11. In the meanwhile the compositors were busy setting up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the early sheets of <span class="ins" title="originally: the">The</span> Golden Legend. The printing of
Poems by the Way, which its author first thought of calling
Flores Atramenti, was not begun until July. The poems
in it were written at various times. In the manuscript,
Hafbur and Signy is dated February 4, 1870; Hildebrand
and Hillilel, March 1, 1871; and Love&rsquo;s Reward, Kelmscott,
April 21, 1871. Meeting in Winter is a song from The Story
of Orpheus, an unpublished poem intended for The Earthly
Paradise. The last poem in the book, Goldilocks and Goldilocks,
was written on May 20, 1891, for the purpose of adding
to the bulk of the volume, which was then being prepared.
A few of the vellum covers were stained at Merton
red, yellow, indigo, and dark green, but the experiment
was not successful.</p>

<p>This chapter of the Stones of Venice, which Ruskin always
considered the most important in the book, was first printed
separately in 1854 as a sixpenny pamphlet. Mr. Morris paid
more than one tribute to it in Hopes and Fears for Art. Of

<p>This book was set up from a copy of the edition published
by Reeves &amp; Turner in 1889, the only alteration, except a
few corrections, being in the 11th line of Summer Dawn.
It is divided into three parts, the poems suggested by Malory&rsquo;s
Morte d&rsquo;Arthur, the poems inspired by Froissart&rsquo;s
Chronicles, and poems on various subjects. The two first
sections have borders, and the last has a half-border. The
first sheet was printed on February 17, 1892. It was the
first book bound in limp vellum, and the only one of which
the title was inscribed by hand on the back.</p>

<p>This was set up with a few alterations from a copy of
Reeves &amp; Turner&rsquo;s third edition, and the printing was begun
on April 4, 1892. The frontispiece was redrawn from
that to the first edition, and engraved on wood by W. H.
Hooper, who engraved all Sir E. Burne-Jones&rsquo; designs for
the Kelmscott Press, except those for The Wood beyond
the World and The Life and Death of Jason. The inscription
below the figures, and the narrow border, were designed
by Mr. Morris, and engraved with the picture on
one block, which was afterwards used on a leaflet printed
for the Ancoats Brotherhood in February, 1894.</p>

<p>In July, 1890, when only a few letters of the Golden type
had been cut, Mr. Morris bought a copy of this book, printed
by Wynkyn de Worde in 1527. He soon afterwards determined
to print it, and on Sept. 11 entered into a formal
agreement with Mr. Quaritch for its publication. It was only
an unforeseen difficulty about the size of the first stock of
paper that led to The Golden Legend not being the first book
put in hand. It was set up from a transcript of Caxton&rsquo;s first
edition, lent by the Syndics of the Cambridge University
Library for the purpose. A trial page was got out in March,
1891, and 50 pages were in type by May 11, the day on
which the first sheet was printed. The first volume was
finished, with the exception of the illustrations and the preliminary
matter, in Oct., 1891. The two illustrations and
the title (which was the first woodcut title designed by Mr.
Morris) were not engraved until June and August, 1892,
when the third volume was approaching completion. About
half a dozen impressions of the illustrations were pulled on
vellum. A slip asking owners of the book not to have it
bound with pressure, nor to have the edges cut instead of
merely trimmed, was inserted in each copy.</p>

<p>This book, begun in February, 1892, is the first book printed
in Troy type, and the first in which Chaucer type appears.
It is a reprint of the first book printed in English. It had
long been a favourite with William Morris, who designed
a great quantity of initials and ornaments for it, and wrote
the following note for Mr. Quaritch&rsquo;s catalogue: &lsquo;As to the
matter of the book, it makes a thoroughly amusing story,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
instinct with medi&aelig;val thought and manners. For though
written at the end of the Middle Ages and dealing with classical
mythology, it has in it no token of the coming Renaissance,
but is merely medi&aelig;val. It is the last issue of that
story of Troy which through the whole of the Middle Ages
had such a hold on men&rsquo;s imaginations; the story built up
from a rumour of the Cyclic Poets, of the heroic City of
Troy, defended by Priam and his gallant sons, led by Hector
the Preux Chevalier, and beset by the violent and brutal
Greeks, who were looked on as the necessary machinery
for bringing about the undeniable tragedy of the fall of the
city. Surely this is well worth reading, if only as a piece
of undiluted medi&aelig;valism.&rsquo; 2000 copies of a 4to announcement,
with specimen pages, were printed at the Kelmscott
Press in December, 1892, for distribution by the publisher.</p>

<p>About this book, which was first announced as in the press
in the list dated July, 1892, William Morris wrote the following
note for Mr. Quaritch&rsquo;s catalogue: &lsquo;This translation
of Caxton&rsquo;s is one of the very best of his works as to style;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and being translated from a kindred tongue is delightful as
mere language. In its rude joviality, and simple and direct
delineation of character, it is a thoroughly good representative
of the famous ancient Beast Epic.&rsquo; The edges of this
book, and of all subsequent books, were trimmed in accordance
with the invariable practice of the early printers. Mr.
Morris much preferred the trimmed edges.</p>

<p>The text of this book was printed before Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Poems and Sonnets, but it was kept back for the frontispiece,
which is a picture of the old manor-house in the village
of Kelmscott by the upper Thames, from which the
Press took its name. It was set up from a copy of one of
Reeves &amp; Turner&rsquo;s editions, and in reading it for the press
the author made a few slight corrections. It was the last
except the Savonarola (No. 31) in which he used the old
paragraph mark <img src="images/p_025c.png" width="12" height="14" alt="" title="" />

colophon. Some of the three-line initials, which were
designed for The Well at the World&rsquo;s End, are used in the
French poem, and this is their first appearance. The translation
was begun on Dec. 3, 1892, and the border round the

and the Kelmscott Press edition was set up from the sheets
of that edition, which, though not issued until October, 1896,

<p>The history of this book, which is by far the most important
achievement of the Kelmscott Press, is as follows. As
far back as June 11, 1891, Mr. Morris spoke of printing a
Chaucer with a black-letter fount which he hoped to design.
Four months later, when most of the Troy type was
designed and cut, he expressed his intention to use it first
on John Ball, and then on a Chaucer and perhaps a Gesta
Romanorum. By January 1, 1892, the Troy type was delivered,
and early in that month two trial pages, one from
The Cook&rsquo;s Tale and one from Sir Thopas, the latter in
double columns, were got out. It then became evident
that the type was too large for a Chaucer, and Mr. Morris
decided to have it re-cut in the size known as pica. By the
end of June he was thus in possession of the type which
in the list issued in December, 1892, he named the Chaucer
type. In July, 1892, another trial page, a passage from The
Knight&rsquo;s Tale in double columns of 58 lines, was got out,
and found to be satisfactory. The idea of the Chaucer as
it now exists, with illustrations by Sir Edward Burne-Jones,
then took definite shape.</p>

<p>In a proof of the first list, dated April, 1892, there is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
announcement of the book as in preparation, in black-letter,
large quarto, but this was struck out, and does not appear
in the list as printed in May, nor yet in the July list. In
that for Dec., 1892, it is announced for the first time as to
be in Chaucer type &lsquo;with about sixty designs by E. Burne-Jones.&rsquo;
The next list, dated March 9, 1893, states that it
will be a folio and that it is in the press, by which was
meant that a few pages were in type. In the list dated
Aug. 1, 1893, the probable price is given as twenty pounds.
The next four lists contain no fresh information, but on
Aug. 17, 1894, nine days after the first sheet was printed,
a notice was sent to the trade that there would be 325
copies at twenty pounds and about sixty woodcuts designed
by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. Three months later it was
decided to increase the number of illustrations to upwards
of seventy, and to print another 100 copies of the book. A
circular letter was sent to subscribers on Nov. 14, stating
this and giving them an opportunity of cancelling their orders.
Orders were not withdrawn, the extra copies were
immediately taken up, and the list for Dec. 1, 1894, which
is the first containing full particulars, announces that all
paper copies are sold.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris began designing his first folio border on Feb.
1, 1893, but was dissatisfied with the design and did not
finish it. Three days later he began the vine border for
the first page, and finished it in about a week, together
with the initial word &lsquo;Whan,&rsquo; the two lines of heading, and
the frame for the first picture, and Mr. Hooper engraved
the whole of these on one block. The first picture was engraved
at about the same time. A specimen of the first
page (differing slightly from the same page as it appears
in the book) was shown at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition
in October and November, 1893, and was issued to a few
leading booksellers, but it was not until August 8, 1894,
that the first sheet was printed at 14, Upper Mall. On Jan.
8, 1895, another press was started at 21, Upper Mall, and
from that time two presses were almost exclusively at work
on the Chaucer. By Sept. 10 the last page of The Romaunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of the Rose was printed. In the middle of Feb., 1896, Mr.
Morris began designing the title. It was finished on the 27th
of the same month and engraved by Mr. Hooper in March.
On May 8, a year and nine months after the printing of the
first sheet, the book was completed. On June 2 the first two
copies were delivered to Sir Edward Burne-Jones and Mr.
Morris. Mr. Morris&rsquo;s copy is now at Exeter College, Oxford,
with other books printed at the Kelmscott Press.</p>

<p>Besides the eighty-seven illustrations designed by Sir
Edward Burne-Jones, and engraved by W. H. Hooper,
the Chaucer contains a woodcut title, fourteen large borders,
eighteen different frames round the illustrations, and
twenty-six large initial words designed for the book by
William Morris. Many of these were engraved by C. E.
Keates, and others by W. H. Hooper and W. Spielmeyer.</p>

<p>In Feb., 1896, a notice was issued respecting special bindings,
of which Mr. Morris intended to design four. Two
of these were to have been executed under Mr. Cobden-Sanderson&rsquo;s
direction at the Doves Bindery, and two by
Messrs. J. &amp; J. Leighton. But the only design that he was
able to complete was for a full white pigskin binding, which
has now been carried out at the Doves Bindery on forty-eight
copies, including two on vellum.</p>

in Mr. Morris&rsquo;s possession, both as regards writing and ornament.
No author&rsquo;s name is given to the poems, but after
this book was issued the Rev. E. S. Dewick pointed out that
they had already been printed at Tegernsee in 1579, in a
16mo volume in which they are ascribed to Stephen Langton.
A note to this effect was printed in the Chaucer type
in Dec. 28, 1896, and distributed to the subscribers.</p>

<p>Two of the initial words from the Chaucer are used in this
book, one at the beginning of each poem. These poems
were formerly attributed to Chaucer, but recent scholarship
has proved that The Floure and the Leafe is much later
than Chaucer, and that The Cuckow and the Nightingale
was written by Sir Thomas Clanvowe about A. D. 1405-10.</p>

<p>Unlike The Well at the World&rsquo;s End, with which it is mainly
uniform, this book has red shoulder-notes and no illustrations.
Mr. Morris began the story in verse on Feb. 4, 1895.
A few days later he began it afresh in alternate prose and
verse; but he was again dissatisfied, and finally began it a
third time in prose alone, as it now stands. It was first announced
as in the press in the list of June 1, 1896, at which
date the early chapters were in type, although they were
not printed until about a month later. The designs for the
initial words &lsquo;Whilom&rsquo; and &lsquo;Empty&rsquo; were begun by William
Morris shortly before his death, and were finished by
R. Catterson-Smith. Another edition was published by
Longmans on Oct. 1, 1897.</p>

contains the following note: &lsquo;The borders in this edition

except those on page 4 of volumes ii., iii., and iv., afterwards
repeated, which were designed to match the opposite
borders, under William Morris&rsquo;s direction, by R. Catterson-Smith;
who also finished the initial words &lsquo;Whilom&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Empty&rsquo; for The Water of the Wondrous Isles. All the
other letters, borders, title-pages and ornaments used at
the Kelmscott Press, except the Greek type in Atalanta in
Calydon, were designed by William Morris.&rsquo;</p>

<p><b><a name="item_46" id="item_46"></a>46. TWO TRIAL PAGES OF THE PROJECTED

heading in Troy type. In black and red. Border 32, containing
the shields of France, the Empire, and England and
a half-border containing those of Reginald Lord Cobham,
Sir John Chandos, and Sir Walter Manny. 160 on vellum

<p>It was the intention of Mr. Morris to make this edition of
what was since his college days almost his favourite book,
a worthy companion to the Chaucer. It was to have been
in two volumes folio, with new cusped initials and heraldic
ornament throughout. Each volume was to have had a
large frontispiece designed by Sir E. Burne-Jones; the subject
of the first was to have been St. George, that of the
second, Fame. A trial page was set up in the Troy type
soon after it came from the foundry, in Jan., 1892. Early
in 1893 trial pages were set up in the Chaucer type, and
in the list for March 9 of that year the book is erroneously
stated to be in the press. In the three following lists it is
announced as in preparation. In the list dated Dec. 1, 1893,
and in the three next lists, it is again announced as in the
press, and the number to be printed is given as 150. Meanwhile
the printing of the Chaucer had been begun, and as
it was not feasible to carry on two folios at the same time,
the Froissart again comes under the heading &lsquo;in preparation&rsquo;
in the lists from Dec. 1, 1894, to June 1, 1896. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
prospectus of the Shepheardes Calender, dated Nov. 12,
1896, it is announced as abandoned. At that time about
thirty-four pages were in type, but no sheet had been
printed. Before the type was broken up, on Dec. 24, 1896,
32 copies of sixteen of these pages were printed and given
as a memento to personal friends of the poet and printer
whose death now made the completion of the book impossible.
This suggested the idea of printing two pages for
wider distribution. The half-border had been engraved
in April, 1894, by W. Spielmeyer, but the large border only
existed as a drawing. It was engraved with great skill and
spirit by C. E. Keates, and the two pages were printed by
Stephen Mowlem, with the help of an apprentice, in a
manner worthy of the designs.</p>

<p>This book, subjects from which were painted by Sir Edward
Burne-Jones on the walls of The Red House, Upton,
Bexley Heath, many years ago, was always a favourite

<p>Of these thirty-five reproductions twenty-nine were all that
were done of a series chosen by Mr. Morris to illustrate a
catalogue of his library, and the other six were prepared
by him for an article in the 4th number of Bibliographica,
part of which is reprinted as an introduction to the book.
The process blocks (with one exception) were made by
Walker &amp; Boutall, and are of the same size as the original cuts.</p>

<p>The two borders used in this book were almost the last that
Mr. Morris designed. They were intended for an edition
of The Hill of Venus, which was to have been written in
prose by him and illustrated by Sir E. Burne-Jones. The
foliage was suggested by the ornament in two Psalters of
the last half of the thirteenth century in the library at Kelmscott
House. The initial A at the beginning of the 3rd book
was designed in March, 1893, for the Froissart, and does
not appear elsewhere.</p>

<p>An edition of Sigurd the Volsung, which Mr. Morris justly
considered his masterpiece, was contemplated early in the
history of the Kelmscott Press. An announcement appears
in a proof of the first list, dated April, 1892, but it was excluded
from the list as issued in May. It did not reappear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
until the list of November 26, 1895, in which, the Chaucer
being near its completion, Sigurd comes under the heading
&lsquo;in preparation,&rsquo; as a folio in Troy type, &lsquo;with about twenty-five
illustrations by Sir E. Burne-Jones.&rsquo; In the list of June
1, 1896, it is finally announced as &lsquo;in the press,&rsquo; the number
of illustrations is increased to forty, and other particulars
are given. Four borders had then been designed for
it, two of which were used on pages 470 and 471 of the
Chaucer. The other two have not been used, though one
of them has been engraved. Two pages only were in type,
thirty-two copies of which were struck off on Jan. 11, 1897,
and given to friends, with the sixteen pages of Froissart
mentioned above.</p>

<p>This was the last romance by William Morris. He began to
write it on Dec. 21, 1895, and dictated the final words on Sept.
8, 1896. The map pasted into the cover was drawn by
H. Cribb for Walker &amp; Boutall, who prepared the block. In
the edition that Longmans are about to issue the bands of
robbers called in the Kelmscott edition Red and Black Skinners
appear correctly as Red and Black Skimmers. The
name was probably suggested by that of the pirates called
&lsquo;escumours of the sea&rsquo; on page 154 of Godefrey of Boloyne.</p>

<p>Other works announced in the lists as in preparation, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
afterwards abandoned, were The Tragedies, Histories, and
Comedies of William Shakespeare; Caxton&rsquo;s Vitas Patrum;
The Poems of Theodore Watts-Dunton; and A Catalogue
of the Collection of Woodcut Books, Early Printed Books,
and Manuscripts at Kelmscott House. The text of the
Shakespeare was to have been prepared by Dr. Furnivall.
The original intention, as first set out in the list of May 20,
1893, was to print it in three vols. folio. A trial page from
<a name="Lady" id="Lady"></a><span class="inso" title="Omit: Lady">Lady</span> Macbeth, printed at this time, is in existence. The
same information is repeated until the list of July 2, 1895,
in which the book is announced as to be a &lsquo;small 4to (special
size),&rsquo; i. e., the size afterwards adopted for The Earthly
Paradise. It was not, however, begun, nor was the volume
of Mr. Watts-Dunton&rsquo;s poems. Of the Vitas Patrum, which
was to have been uniform with The Golden Legend, a prospectus
and specimen page were issued in March, 1894, but
the number of subscribers did not justify its going beyond
this stage. Two trial pages of the Catalogue were set up;
some of the material prepared for it has now appeared in
Some German Woodcuts of the Fifteenth Century. In addition
to these books, The Hill of Venus, as stated on <a name="errata_44_1" id="errata_44_1"></a><a href="#Page_38">p. <span class="ins" title="originally: 57">38</span></a>,
was in preparation. Among works that Mr. Morris had some
thought of printing may also be mentioned The Bible, Gesta
Romanorum, Malory&rsquo;s Morte Darthur, The High History
of the San Graal (translated by Dr. Sebastian Evans), Piers
Ploughman, Huon of Bordeaux, Caxton&rsquo;s Jason, a Latin
Psalter, The Prymer or Lay Folk&rsquo;s Prayer-Book, Some
Medi&aelig;val English Songs and Music, The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,
and a Book of Romantic Ballads. He was engaged on the
selection of the Ballads, which he spoke of as the finest
poems in our language, during his last illness.</p>

MORRIS, DELIVERED BEFORE THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
SOCIETY OF LONDON, MDCCCXCIII.</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the Ideal Book, I suppose we are to understand a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1a" id="Page_1a">[1]</a></span>
not limited by commercial exigencies of price: we can do
what we like with it, according to what its nature, as a
book, demands of art. But we may conclude, I think, that
its matter will limit us somewhat; a work on differential
calculus, a medical work, a dictionary, a collection of a
statesman&rsquo;s speeches, or a treatise on manures, such books,
though they might be handsomely and well printed, would
scarcely receive ornament with the same exuberance as a
volume of lyrical poems, or a standard classic, or such
like. A work on Art, I think, bears less of ornament than
any other kind of book (&ldquo;non bis in idem&rdquo; is a good
motto); again, a book that must have illustrations, more
or less utilitarian, should, I think, have no actual ornament
at all, because the ornament and the illustration must almost
certainly fight.</p>

<p>Still whatever the subject matter of the book may be, and
however bare it may be of decoration, it can still be a
work of art, if the type be good and attention be paid to
its general arrangement. All here present, I should suppose,
will agree in thinking an opening of Sch&oelig;ffer&rsquo;s 1462
Bible beautiful, even when it has neither been illuminated
nor rubricated; the same may be said of Schussler, or
Jenson, or, in short, of any of the good old printers; their
books, without any further ornament than they derived
from the design and arrangement of the letters, were definite
works of art. In fact a book, printed or written, has
a tendency to be a beautiful object, and that we of this age
should generally produce ugly books, shows, I fear, something
like malice prepense&mdash;a <a name="determination" id="determination"></a>
<span class="ins" title="Originally: determation">determination</span> to put our eyes
in our pockets wherever we can.</p>

<p>Well, I lay it down, first, that a book quite unornamented
can look actually and positively beautiful, and not merely
un-ugly, if it be, so to say, architecturally good, which, by
the by, need not add much to its price, since it costs no
more to pick up pretty stamps than ugly ones, and the taste
and forethought that goes to the proper setting, position,
and so on, will soon grow into a habit, if cultivated, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2a" id="Page_2a">[2]</a></span>
will not take up much of the master printer&rsquo;s time when
taken with his other necessary business.</p>

<p>Now, then, let us see what this architectural arrangement
claims of us. First, the pages must be clear and easy to
read; which they can hardly be unless, Secondly, the type
is well designed; and Thirdly, whether the margins be
small or big, they must be in due proportion to the page of
the letter.</p>

<p>For clearness of reading the things necessary to be heeded
are, first, that the letters should be properly put on their
bodies, and, I think, especially that there should be small
whites between them; it is curious, but to me certain, that
the irregularity of some early type, notably the roman letter
of the early printers of Rome, which is, of all roman
type, the rudest, does not tend toward illegibility: what
does so is the lateral compression of the letter, which necessarily
involves the over thinning out of its shape. Of course
I do not mean to say that the above-mentioned irregularity
is other than a fault to be corrected. One thing should
never be done in ideal printing, the spacing out of letters&mdash;that
is, putting an extra white between them; except in
such hurried and unimportant work as newspaper printing,
it is inexcusable.</p>

<p>This leads to the second matter on this head, the lateral
spacing of words (the whites between them); to make a
beautiful page great attention should be paid to this, which,
I fear, is not often done. No more white should be used
between the words than just clearly cuts them off from one
another; if the whites are bigger than this it both tends to
illegibility and makes the page ugly. I remember once
buying a handsome fifteenth-century Venetian book, and
I could not tell at first why some of its pages were so worrying
to read, and so commonplace and vulgar to look at,
for there was no fault to find with the type. But presently
it was accounted for by the spacing: for the said pages
were spaced like a modern book, i. e., the black and white
nearly equal. Next, if you want a legible book, the white
should be clear and the black black. When that excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3a" id="Page_3a">[3]</a></span>
journal, the Westminster Gazette, first came out, there was
a discussion on the advantages of its green paper, in which
a good deal of nonsense was talked. My friend, Mr. Jacobi,
being a practical printer, set these wise men right, if they
noticed his letter, as I fear they did not, by pointing out
that what they had done was to lower the tone (not the
moral tone) of the paper, and that, therefore, in order to
make it as legible as ordinary black and white, they should
make their black blacker&mdash;which of course they do not do.
You may depend upon it that a gray page is very trying
to the eyes.</p>

<p>As above said, legibility depends also much on the design
of the letter: and again I take up the cudgels against compressed
type, and that especially in roman letter: the full-sized
lower-case letters &ldquo;a,&rdquo; &ldquo;b,&rdquo; &ldquo;d,&rdquo; and &ldquo;c,&rdquo; should be
designed on something like a square to get good results:
otherwise one may fairly say that there is no room for the
design; furthermore, each letter should have its due characteristic
drawing, the thickening out for a &ldquo;b,&rdquo; &ldquo;e,&rdquo; &ldquo;g,&rdquo;
should not be of the same kind as that for a &ldquo;d&rdquo;; a &ldquo;u&rdquo;
should not merely be an &ldquo;n&rdquo; turned upside down; the dot of
the &ldquo;i&rdquo; should not be a circle drawn with compasses; but
a delicately drawn diamond, and so on. To be short, the
letters should be designed by an artist, and not an engineer.
As to the forms of letters in England (I mean Great
Britain), there has been much progress within the last forty
years. The sweltering hideousness of the Bodoni letter,
the most illegible type that was ever cut, with its preposterous
thicks and thins, has been mostly relegated to works
that do not profess anything but the baldest utilitarianism
(though why even utilitarianism should use illegible types,
I fail to see), and Caslon&rsquo;s letter and the somewhat wiry,
but in its way, elegant old-faced type cut in our own days,
has largely taken its place. It is rather unlucky, however,
that a somewhat low standard of excellence has been accepted
for the design of modern roman type at its best,
the comparatively poor and wiry letter of Plantin and
the Elzevirs having served for the model, rather than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4a" id="Page_4a">[4]</a></span>
generous and logical designs of the fifteenth-century Venetian
printers, at the head of whom stands Nicholas Jenson;
when it is so obvious that this is the best and clearest roman
type yet struck, it seems a pity that we should make our
starting-point for a possible new departure at any period
worse than the best. If any of you doubt the superiority
of this type over that of the seventeenth century, the study
of a specimen enlarged about five times will convince him,
I should think. I must admit, however, that a commercial
consideration comes in here, to wit, that the Jenson letters
take up more room than the imitations of the seventeenth
century; and that touches on another commercial difficulty,
to wit, that you cannot have a book either handsome or
clear to read which is printed in small characters. For
my part, except where books smaller than an ordinary
octavo are wanted, I would fight against anything smaller
than pica; but at any rate small pica seems to me the
smallest type that should be used in the body of any book.
I might suggest to printers that if they want to get more
in they can reduce the size of the leads, or leave them out
altogether. Of course this is more desirable in some types
than in others; Caslon&rsquo;s letter, e. g., which has long ascenders
and descenders, never needs leading, except for special
purposes.</p>

<p>I have hitherto had a fine and generous roman type in
my mind, but after all a certain amount of variety is desirable,
and when you have gotten your roman letter as
good as the best that has been, I do not think you will
find much scope for development of it; I would therefore
put in a word for some form of gothic letter for use in
our improved printed book. This may startle some of
you, but you must remember that except for a very remarkable
type used very seldom by Berthelette (I have
only seen two books in this type. Bartholomew, the Englishman,
and the Gower, of 1532), English black-letter,
since the days of Wynkin de Worde, has been always
the letter which was introduced from Holland about that
time (I except again, of course, the modern imitations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5a" id="Page_5a">[5]</a></span>
Caxton). Now this, though a handsome and stately letter,
is not very easy reading; it is too much compressed, too
spiky, and so to say, too prepensely gothic. But there are
many types which are of a transitional character and of
all degrees of transition, from those which do little more
than take in just a little of the crisp floweriness of the
gothic, like some of the Mentelin or quasi-Mentelin ones
(which, indeed, are models of beautiful simplicity), or say
like the letter of the Ulm Ptolemy, of which it is difficult
to say whether it is gothic or roman, to the splendid Mainz
type, of which, I suppose, the finest specimen is the Sch&oelig;ffer
Bible of 1462, which is almost wholly gothic. This gives
us a wide field for variety, I think, so I make the suggestion
to you, and leave this part of the subject with two
remarks: first, that a good deal of the difficulty of reading
gothic books is caused by the numerous contractions in
them, which were a survival of the practice of the scribes;
and in a lesser degree by the over-abundance of tied letters,
both of which drawbacks, I take it for granted, would
be absent in modern types founded on these semi-gothic
letters. And, secondly, that in my opinion the capitals are
the strong side of roman and the lower-case of gothic letter,
which is but natural, since the roman was originally
an alphabet of capitals, and the lower case a gradual deduction
from them.</p>

<p>We now come to the position of the page of print on the
paper, which is a most important point, and one that till
quite lately has been wholly misunderstood by modern,
and seldom done wrong by ancient printers, or indeed by
producers of books of any kind. On this head I must begin
by reminding you that we only occasionally see one
page of a book at a time; the two pages making an opening
are really the unit of the book, and this was thoroughly
understood by the old book producers. I think you will seldom
find a book produced before the eighteenth century,
and which has not been cut down by that enemy of books
(and of the human race), the binder, in which this rule is
not adhered to: that the binder edge (that which is bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6a" id="Page_6a">[6]</a></span>
in) must be the smallest member of the margins, the head
margin must be larger than this, the fore larger still, and
the tail largest of all. I assert that, to the eye of any man
who knows what proportion is, this looks satisfactory, and
that no other does so look. But the modern printer, as a
rule, dumps down the page in what he calls the middle of
the paper, which is often not even really the middle, as he
measures his page from the head line, if he has one, though
it is not really a part of the page, but a spray of type only
faintly staining the head of the paper. Now I go so far as
to say that any book in which the page is properly put on
the paper is tolerable to look at, however poor the type
may be (always so long as there is no &ldquo;ornament&rdquo; which
may spoil the whole thing), whereas any book in which
the page is wrongly set on the paper is intolerable to look
at, however good the type and ornaments may be. I have
got on my shelves now a Jenson&rsquo;s Latin Pliny, which, in
spite of its beautiful type and handsome painted ornaments,
I dare scarcely look at, because the binder (adjectives
fail me here) has chopped off two-thirds of the tail
margin: such stupidities are like a man with his coat buttoned
up behind, or a lady with her bonnet on hind-side
foremost.</p>

<p>Before I finish I should like to say a word concerning
large-paper copies. I am clean against them, though I
have sinned a good deal in that way myself, but that was
in the days of ignorance, and I petition for pardon on that
ground only. If you want to publish a handsome edition
of a book, as well as a cheap one, do so, but let them be two
books, and if you (or the public) cannot afford this, spend
your ingenuity and your money in making the cheap book
as sightly as you can. Your making a large-paper copy
out of the small one lands you in a dilemma even if you
re-impose the pages for the large paper, which is not often
done, I think. If the margins are right for the smaller book
they must be wrong for the larger, and you have to offer
the public the worse book at the bigger price; if they are
right for the large paper they are wrong for the small, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7a" id="Page_7a">[7]</a></span>
thus spoil it, as we have seen above that they must do; and
that seems scarcely fair to the general public (from the
point of view of artistic morality) who might have had a
book that was sightly, though not high-priced.</p>

<p>As to the paper of our ideal book, we are at a great disadvantage
compared with past times. Up to the end of the
fifteenth, or indeed, the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries,
no bad paper was made, and the greater part was
very good indeed. At present there is very little good paper
made and most of it is very bad. Our ideal book must,
I think, be printed on hand-made paper as good as it can
be made; penury here will make a poor book of it. Yet if
machine-made paper must be used, it should not profess
fineness or luxury, but should show itself for what it is:
for my part I decidedly prefer the cheaper papers that are
used for the journals, so far as appearance is concerned,
to the thick, smooth, sham-fine papers on which respectable
books are printed, and the worst of these are those
which imitate the structure of hand-made papers.</p>

<p>But, granted your hand-made paper, there is something to
be said about the substance. A small book should not be
printed on thick paper, however good it may be. You
want a book to turn over easily, and to lie quiet while you
are reading it, which is impossible, unless you keep heavy
paper for big books.</p>

<p>And, by the way, I wish to make a protest against the superstition
that only small books are comfortable to read;
some small books are tolerably comfortable, but the best
of them are not so comfortable as a fairly big folio, the
size, say, of an uncut Polyphilus or somewhat bigger. The
fact is, a small book seldom does lie quiet, and you have
to cramp your hand by holding it or else put it on the
table with a paraphernalia of matters to keep it down, a
tablespoon on one side, a knife on another, and so on,
which things always tumble off at a critical moment, and
fidget you out of the repose which is absolutely necessary
to reading; whereas, a big folio lies quiet and majestic on
the table, waiting kindly till you please to come to it, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8a" id="Page_8a">[8]</a></span>
its leaves flat and peaceful, giving you no trouble of body,
so that your mind is free to enjoy the literature which its
beauty enshrines.</p>

<p>So far then, I have been speaking of books whose only ornament
is the necessary and essential beauty which arises
out of the fitness of a piece of craftsmanship for the use
which it is made for. But if we get as far as that, no doubt
from such craftsmanship definite ornament will arise, and
will be used, sometimes with wise forbearance, sometimes
with prodigality equally wise. Meantime, if we really feel
impelled to ornament our books, no doubt we ought to try
what we can do; but in this attempt we must remember one
thing, that if we think the ornament is ornamentally a part of
the book merely because it is printed with it, and bound up
with it, we shall be much mistaken. The ornament must
form as much a part of the book as the type itself, or it will
miss its mark, and in order to succeed, and to be ornament,
it must submit to certain limitations, and become architectural;
a mere black and white picture, however interesting
it may be as a picture, may be far from an ornament in a
book; while on the other hand a book ornamented with pictures
that are suitable for that, and that alone, may become
a work of art second to none, save a fine building duly decorated,
or a fine piece of literature.</p>

<p>These two latter things are, indeed, the one absolutely
necessary gift that we should claim of art. The picture-book
is not, perhaps, absolutely necessary to man&rsquo;s life,
but it gives us such endless pleasure, and is so intimately
connected with the other absolutely necessary art of imaginative
literature that it must remain one of the very
worthiest things toward the production of which reasonable
men should strive.</p>

AND EMERY WALKER, FROM ARTS AND CRAFTS
ESSAYS BY MEMBERS OF THE ARTS AND CRAFTS
EXHIBITION SOCIETY.</h1><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10a" id="Page_10a"><!-- not printed [10] --></a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Printing, in the only sense with which we are at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11a" id="Page_11a">[11]</a></span>
concerned, differs from most if not from all the arts and
crafts represented in the exhibition in being comparatively
modern. For although the Chinese took impressions from
wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the
wood-cutters of the Netherlands, by a similar process, produced
the block books, which were the immediate predecessors
of the true printed book, the invention of movable
metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may
justly be considered as the invention of the art of printing.
And it is worth mention in passing that, as an example of
fine typography, the earliest book printed with movable
types, the Gutenberg, or &ldquo;forty-two line Bible&rdquo; of about
1455, has never been surpassed.</p>

<p>Printing, then, for our purpose, may be considered as the
art of making books by means of movable types. Now, as
all books not primarily intended as picture-books consist
principally of types composed to form letterpress, it is of
the first importance that the letter used should be fine in
form; especially as no more time is occupied, or cost incurred,
in casting, setting, or printing beautiful letters than
in the same operations with ugly ones. And it was a matter
of course that in the Middle Ages, when the craftsmen
took care that beautiful form should always be a part of
their productions whatever they were, the forms of printed
letters should be beautiful, and that their arrangement on
the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness
of the letters themselves. The Middle Ages brought
caligraphy to perfection, and it was natural therefore that
the forms of printed letters should follow more or less
closely those of the written character, and they followed
them very closely. The first books were printed in black
letter, i. e., the letter which was a Gothic development of
the ancient Roman character, and which developed more
completely and satisfactorily on the side of the &ldquo;lower-case&rdquo;
than the capital letters; the &ldquo;lower-case&rdquo; being in
fact invented in the early Middle Ages. The earliest book
printed with movable type, the aforesaid Gutenberg Bible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12a" id="Page_12a">[12]</a></span>
is printed in letters which are an exact imitation of the more
formal ecclesiastical writing which obtained at that time;
this has since been called &ldquo;missal type,&rdquo; and was in fact
the kind of letter used in the many splendid missals, psalters,
etc., produced by printing in the fifteenth century. But the
first Bible actually dated (which also was printed at
<a name="Mainz" id="Mainz"></a><span class="ins" title="Originally: Maintz">Mainz</span>
by Peter Sch&oelig;ffer in the year 1462) imitates a much freer
hand, simpler, rounder, and less spiky, and therefore far
pleasanter and easier to read. On the whole the type of this
book may be considered the ne-plus-ultra of Gothic type,
especially as regards the lower-case letters; and type very
similar was used during the next fifteen or twenty years
not only by Sch&oelig;ffer, but by printers in Strasburg, Basle,
Paris, Lubeck, and other cities. But though on the whole,
except in Italy, Gothic letter was most often used, a very
few years saw the birth of Roman character not only in
Italy, but in Germany and France. In 1465 Sweynheim
and Pannartz began printing in the monastery of Subiaco
near Rome, and used an exceedingly beautiful type, which
is indeed to look at a transition between Gothic and Roman,
but which must certainly have come from the study
of the twelfth or even the eleventh century MSS. They
printed very few books in this type, three only; but in their
very first books in Rome, beginning with the year 1468,
they discarded this for a more completely Roman and far
less beautiful letter. But about the same year Mentelin at
Strasburg began to print in a type which is distinctly Roman;
and the next year Gunther Zeiner at Augsburg followed
suit; while in 1470 at Paris Udalric Gering and his
associates turned out the first books printed in France, also
in Roman character. The Roman type of all these printers
is similar in character, and is very simple and legible, and
unaffectedly designed for use; but it is by no means without
beauty. It must be said that it is in no way like the
transition type of Subiaco, and though more Roman than
that, yet scarcely more like the complete Roman type of
the earliest printers of Rome.</p>

<p>A further development of the Roman letter took place at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13a" id="Page_13a">[13]</a></span>
Venice. John of Spires and his brother Vindelin, followed
by Nicholas Jenson, began to print in that city, 1469, 1470;
their type is on the lines of the German and French rather
than of the Roman printers. Of Jenson it must be said that
he carried the development of Roman type as far as it can
go: his letter is admirably clear and regular, but at least
as beautiful as any other Roman type. After his death in
the &ldquo;fourteen eighties,&rdquo; or at least by 1490, printing in Venice
had declined very much; and though the famous family of
Aldus restored its technical excellence, rejecting battered
letters, and paying great attention to the &ldquo;press work&rdquo; or
actual process of printing, yet their type is artistically on
a much lower level than Jenson&rsquo;s, and in fact they must be
considered to have ended the age of fine printing in Italy.
Jenson, however, had many contemporaries who used beautiful
type, some of which&mdash;as, e. g., that of Jacobus Rubeus
or Jacques le Rouge&mdash;is scarcely distinguishable from his.
It was these great Venetian printers, together with their
brethren of Rome, Milan, Parma, and one or two other cities,
who produced the splendid editions of the Classics, which
are one of the great glories of the printer&rsquo;s art, and are worthy
representatives of the eager enthusiasm for the revived
learning of that epoch. By far the greater part of these Italian
printers, it should be mentioned, were Germans or Frenchmen,
working under the influence of Italian opinion and aims.
It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth
and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries the Roman
letter was used side by side with the Gothic. Even in Italy
most of the theological and law books were printed in Gothic
letter, which was generally more formally Gothic than the
printing of the German workmen, many of whose types,
indeed, like that of the Subiaco works, are of a transitional
character. This was notably the case with the early works
printed at Ulm, and in a somewhat lesser degree at Augsburg.
In fact Gunther Zeiner&rsquo;s first type (afterwards used
by Schussler) is remarkably like the type of the before-mentioned
Subiaco books.</p>

<p>In the Low Countries and Cologne, which were very fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14a" id="Page_14a">[14]</a></span>
of printed books, Gothic was the favourite. The characteristic
Dutch type, as represented by the excellent printer
Gerard Leew, is very pronounced and uncompromising
Gothic. This type was introduced into England by Wynkyn
de Worde, Caxton&rsquo;s successor, and was used there with very
little variation all through the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, and indeed into the eighteenth. Most of Caxton&rsquo;s
own types are of an earlier character, though they also
much resemble Flemish or Cologne letter. After the end
of the fifteenth century the degradation of printing, especially
in Germany and Italy, went on apace; and by the
end of the sixteenth century there was no really beautiful
printing done: the best, mostly French or Low-Country,
was neat and clear, but without any distinction; the worst,
which perhaps was the English, was a terrible falling-off
from the work of the earlier presses; and things got worse
and worse through the whole of the seventeenth century,
so that in the eighteenth printing was very miserably performed.
In England about this time, an attempt was made
(notably by Caslon, who started business in London as a
type-founder in 1720) to improve the letter in form. Caslon&rsquo;s
type is clear and neat, and fairly well designed; he
seems to have taken the letter of the Elzevirs of the seventeenth
century for his model: type cast from his matrices
is still in everyday use.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of his praiseworthy efforts, printing had
still one last degradation to undergo. The seventeenth century
founts were bad rather negatively than positively. But
for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed
tolerable. It was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth
century to produce letters which are positively ugly,
and which, it may be added, are dazzling and unpleasant
to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar thinning
of the lines: for the seventeenth-century letters are at
least pure and simple in line. The Italian, Bodoni, and the
Frenchman, Didot, were the leaders in this luckless change,
though our own Baskerville, who was at work some years
before them, went much on the same lines; but his letters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15a" id="Page_15a">[15]</a></span>
though uninteresting and poor, are not nearly so gross and
vulgar as those of either the Italian or the Frenchman.</p>

<p>With this change the art of printing touched bottom, so far
as fine printing is concerned, though paper did not get to
its worst till about 1840. The Chiswick press in 1844 revived
Caslon&rsquo;s founts, printing for Messrs. Longman the
Diary of Lady Willoughby. This experiment was so far
successful that about 1850 Messrs. Miller and Richard of
Edinburgh were induced to cut punches for a series of &ldquo;old
style&rdquo; letters. These and similar founts, cast by the above
firm and others, have now come into general use and are
obviously a great improvement on the ordinary &ldquo;modern
style&rdquo; in use in England, which is in fact the Bodoni type
a little reduced in ugliness. The design of the letters of this
modern &ldquo;old style&rdquo; leaves a good deal to be desired, and
the whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness
of the letters. It must be remembered, however, that most
modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper, and
not by the hand press, and these somewhat wiry letters are
suitable for the machine process, which would not do justice
to letters of more generous design.</p>

<p>It is discouraging to note that the improvement of the last
fifty years is almost wholly confined to Great Britain. Here
and there a book is printed in France or Germany with some
pretension to good taste, but the general revival of the old
forms has made no way in those countries. Italy is contentedly
stagnant. America has produced a good many
showy books, the typography, paper, and illustrations of
which are, however, all wrong, oddity rather than rational
beauty and meaning being apparently the thing sought for
both in the letters and the illustrations.</p>

<p>To say a few words on the principles of design in typography:
it is obvious that legibility is the first thing to be aimed
at in the forms of the letters; this is best furthered by the
avoidance of irrational swellings and spiky projections, and
by the using of careful purity of line. Even the
<a name="Caslon" id="Caslon"></a><span class="ins" title="Originally: Calson">Caslon</span> type
when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect:
the ends of many of the letters such as the t and e are hooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16a" id="Page_16a">[16]</a></span>
up in a vulgar and meaningless way, instead of ending in
the sharp and clear stroke of Jenson&rsquo;s letters; there is a
grossness in the upper finishings of letters like the c, the
a, and so on, an ugly pear-shaped swelling defacing the form
of the letter: in short, it happens to this craft, as to others,
that the utilitarian practice, though it professes to avoid ornament,
still clings to a foolish, because misunderstood conventionality,
deduced from what was once ornament, and is
by no means useful; which title can only be claimed by artistic
practice, whether the art in it be conscious or unconscious.</p>

<p>In no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar
illegibility of the modern type and the elegance and legibility
of the ancient more striking than in the Arabic numerals.
In the old print each figure has its definite individuality,
and one cannot be mistaken for the other; in reading the modern
figures the eyes must be strained before the reader can
have any reasonable assurance that he has a 5, an 8, or a 3
before him, unless the press work is of the best; this is awkward
if you have to read Bradshaw&rsquo;s Guide in a hurry.</p>

<p>One of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian
must probably be put down to a misapprehension
of a commercial necessity: this is the narrowing of the modern
letters. Most of Jenson&rsquo;s letters are designed within a
square, the modern letters are narrowed by a third or thereabout;
but while this gain of space very much hampers
the possibility of beauty of design, it is not a real gain, for
the modern printer throws the gain away by putting inordinately
wide spaces between his lines, which, probably,
the lateral compression of his letters renders necessary.
Commercialism again compels the use of type too small in
size to be comfortable reading: the size known as &ldquo;Long
primer&rdquo; ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant
to be read. Here, again, if the practice of &ldquo;leading&rdquo; were
retrenched larger type could be used
<a name="without" id="without"></a><span class="ins" title="Originally: witout">without</span> enhancing
the price of a book.</p>

<p>One very important matter in &ldquo;setting up&rdquo; for fine printing
is the &ldquo;spacing,&rdquo; that is, the lateral distance of words
from one another. In good printing the spaces between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17a" id="Page_17a">[17]</a></span>
the words should be as near as possible equal (it is impossible
that they should be quite equal except in lines of poetry);
modern printers understand this, but it is only practised
in the very best establishments. But another point
which they should attend to they almost always disregard;
this is the tendency to the formation of ugly meandering
white lines or &ldquo;rivers&rdquo; in the page, a blemish which can be
nearly, though not wholly, avoided by care and forethought,
the desirable thing being &ldquo;the breaking of the line&rdquo; as in
bonding masonry or brickwork, thus:
<img src="images/i_068a3.png" width="83" height="16" alt="line illustration showing brickwork arrangement" title="" />
The
general solidity of a page is much to be sought for: modern
printers generally overdo the &ldquo;whites&rdquo; in the spacing,
a defect probably forced on them by the characterless quality
of the letters. For where these are boldly and carefully
designed, and each letter is thoroughly individual in form,
the words may be set much closer together, without loss
of clearness. No definite rules, however, except the avoidance
of &ldquo;rivers&rdquo; and excess of white, can be given for the
spacing, which requires the constant exercise of judgment
and taste on the part of the printer.</p>

<p>The position of the page on the paper should be considered
if the book is to have a satisfactory look. Here once more
the almost invariable modern practice is in opposition to a
natural sense of proportion. From the time when books
first took their present shape till the end of the sixteenth
century, or indeed later, the page so lay on the paper that
there was more space allowed to the bottom and fore margin
than to the top and back of the paper, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 111px;">
<img src="images/i_068b2.png" width="111" height="80" alt="drawing of a book showing text block layout" title="" />
</div>


<p>the unit of the book being looked on as the two pages forming
an opening. The modern printer, in the teeth of the evidence
given by his own eyes, considers the single page as
the unit, and prints the page in the middle of his paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18a" id="Page_18a">[18]</a></span>&mdash;only
nominally so, however, in many cases, since when he
uses a headline he counts that in, the result as measured by
the eye being that the lower margin is less than the top one,
and that the whole opening has an upside-down look vertically,
and that laterally the page looks as if it were being
driven off the paper.</p>

<p>The paper on which the printing is to be done is a necessary
part of our subject: of this it may be said that though
there is some good paper made now, it is never used except
for very expensive books, although it would not materially
increase the cost in all but the very cheapest. The
paper that is used for ordinary books is exceedingly bad
even in this country, but is beaten in the race for vileness
by that made in America, which is the worst conceivable.
There seems to be no reason why ordinary paper should
not be better made, even allowing the necessity for a very
low price; but any improvement must be based on showing
openly that the cheap article is cheap, e. g., the cheap
paper should not sacrifice toughness and durability to a
smooth and white surface, which should be indications of
a delicacy of material and manufacture which would of
necessity increase its cost. One fruitful source of badness
in paper is the habit that publishers have of eking out a
thin volume by printing it on thick paper almost of the substance
of cardboard, a device which deceives nobody, and
makes a book very unpleasant to read. On the whole, a
small book should be printed on paper which is as thin as
may be without being transparent. The paper used for
printing the small highly ornamented French service-books
about the beginning of the sixteenth century is a model in
this respect, being thin, tough, and opaque. However, the
fact must not be blinked that machine-made paper cannot
in the nature of things be made of so good a texture as
that made by hand.</p>

<p>The ornamentation of printed books is too wide a subject
to be dealt with fully here; but one thing must be said on
it. The essential point to be remembered is that the ornament,
whatever it is, whether picture or pattern-work, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19a" id="Page_19a">[19]</a></span>
form part of the page, should be a part of the whole scheme
of the book. Simple as this proposition is, it is necessary
to be stated, because the modern practice is to disregard
the relation between the printing and the ornament altogether,
so that if the two are helpful to one another it is a
mere matter of accident. The due relation of letter to pictures
and other ornament was thoroughly understood by
the old printers; so that even when the woodcuts are very
rude indeed, the proportions of the page still give pleasure
by the sense of richness that the cuts and letter together
convey. When, as is most often the case, there is actual
beauty in the cuts, the books so ornamented are amongst
the most delightful works of art that have ever been produced.
Therefore, granted well-designed type, due spacing
of the lines and words, and proper position of the page on
the paper, all books might be at least comely and well-looking:
and if to these good qualities were added really
beautiful ornament and pictures, printed books might once
again illustrate to the full the position of our Society that
a work of utility might be also a work of art, if we cared
to make it so.</p>

belongs to them: others there are who
scorn it and the tameness of it: not
I any the more: though it would indeed
be hard if there were nothing
else in the world, no wonders, no terrors,
no unspeakable beauties. Yet
when we think what a small part of
the world&rsquo;s history, past, present, &amp;
to come, is this land we live in, and
how much smaller still in the history
of the arts, &amp; yet how our forefathers

<p>pains they adorned it, this unromantic, uneventful-looking
land of England, surely by
this too our hearts may be touched and our
hope quickened.</p>

<p>For as was the land,
such was the art of it
while folk yet troubled
themselves about
such things; it strove
little to impress people
either by pomp or
ingenuity: not unseldom
it fell into commonplace,
rarely it rose
into majesty; yet was it never oppressive,
never a slave&rsquo;s nightmare or an
insolent boast: &amp; at its best it had an
inventiveness, an individuality, that
grander styles have never overpassed:
its best too, and that was in its
very heart, was given as freely to the
yeoman&rsquo;s house, and the humble village
church, as to the lord&rsquo;s palace or
the mighty cathedral: never coarse,
though often rude enough, sweet, natural
&amp; unaffected, an art of peasants
rather than of merchant princes or courtiers,
it must be a hard heart, I think, that
does not love it: whether a man has been born
among it like ourselves, or has come wonderingly</p>

she is so much in the pay of the counting-house,
the counting-house and the drill-sergeant,

black dye without
turning it into the

her attention as the production of
the heaviest of heavy black silks,
or the biggest of useless guns.
Anyhow, however it be done, unless
people care about carrying on
their business without making the
world hideous, how can they care
about art? I know it will cost much
both of time and money to better
these things even a little; but I do</p>

<p>not see how these can be better spent than in
making life cheerful &amp; honourable for others
and for ourselves; and the gain of good life
to the country at large that would result from
men seriously setting about the bettering
of the decency of our big towns would be
priceless, even if nothing specially good befell
the arts in consequence: I do not know
that it would; but I should begin to think
matters hopeful if men turned their attention
to such things, and I repeat that, unless
they do so, we can scarcely even begin with
any hope our endeavours for the bettering of
the Arts. (From the lecture called The Lesser
